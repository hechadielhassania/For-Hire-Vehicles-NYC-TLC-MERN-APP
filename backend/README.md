# Backend README

## Overview
This project is the backend implementation of a web application designed to manage reviews for drivers. It provides RESTful API endpoints for performing CRUD operations on reviews and integrates with a MongoDB database.

## Problem
The problem addressed by this backend is to create a scalable and efficient solution for managing reviews for drivers. This involves providing endpoints for adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting reviews, as well as integrating with a database to persist review data.

## Solution
The solution involves developing a Node.js and Express.js backend that exposes RESTful API endpoints for managing reviews. MongoDB is used as the database to store review data. The backend handles requests from the frontend, performs necessary operations on the database, and returns appropriate responses.

## Features
- CRUD operations for reviews (Create, Read, Update, Delete)
- Integration with MongoDB for data storage
- RESTful API endpoints for managing reviews
- Error handling and validation of incoming requests
- CORS support for cross-origin requests
- Environment variable configuration using dotenv

## Technology
- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB
- Mongoose
- dotenv
- CORS middleware

## APIs Used
- None (Custom backend API)
