# Frontend README

## Overview
This project is the frontend implementation of a web application designed to manage reviews for drivers. It provides a user interface for users to view, add, edit, and delete reviews for drivers.

## Problem
The problem addressed by this frontend is to create an intuitive and user-friendly interface for managing reviews. This involves designing and implementing UI components for displaying reviews, adding new reviews, editing existing reviews, and deleting reviews.

## Solution
The solution involves developing a React.js frontend that communicates with the backend API to perform CRUD operations on reviews. Tailwind CSS is used for styling the user interface, providing a modern and responsive design. The frontend fetches data from the backend and renders it in the browser, allowing users to interact with reviews.

## Features
