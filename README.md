## 📖 Overview

Hire Vehicles NYC TLC aims to improve the taxi service in New York City by leveraging user reviews and data transparency. This project provides an interface for users to review drivers, helping to highlight top performers and areas needing improvement.

2. **Driver Profiles**: Detailed profiles for each driver, including license information and review summaries.
